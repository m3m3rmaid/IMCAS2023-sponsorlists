## Introduction
The IMCAS 2023 Sponsor List Analysis project focuses on understanding the sponsorship landscape of the IMCAS conference within the aesthetic and medical device industry. By gathering, analyzing, and visualizing sponsorship data, the project aims to gain insights into the geographical distribution of sponsors, industry segments, sponsorship growth over time, and emerging trends within the industry.

## Data Collection
The project involves web scraping the sponsorship data from the IMCAS 2023 conference website using Python. The collected data includes information about the sponsors, such as their company names, industries, countries, and product types. Additionally, efforts were made to gather historical sponsorship data from previous years (2016-2023) to provide a comprehensive overview of sponsorship trends.

## Data Analysis
The collected data was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to answer specific questions:

- Geographical Distribution: Sponsors' locations were categorized by country and continent to identify regions with the highest sponsorship involvement.

- Industry Segmentation: Sponsors were classified into industry segments (e.g., skincare, surgical equipment, non-invasive treatments) to identify the primary areas of investment within the aesthetic market.

- Sponsorship Growth Over Time: A comparison of sponsorship data across multiple years (2016-2023) was conducted to understand changes in sponsor counts and industry preferences over time.

- Emerging Trends: By analyzing historical data and recent trends, emerging sectors within the aesthetic industry were identified, along with insights into growth and decline in terms of IMCAS involvement.
